# MAWI Traffic Analyzer

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It analyzes real-world IP packet captures from the [MAWI dataset](http://mawi.wide.ad.jp/mawi/) and provides advanced traffic statistics, interactive visualizations, and marketing environment insights.

## üì° About the Dataset

MAWI (Measurement and Analysis on the WIDE Internet) is a project by the WIDE Project in Japan. It provides anonymized traffic captures from backbone networks connecting academic and commercial environments. Daily samples (15 minutes long) are offered in `.pcap.gz` format, along with collection metadata.

## üß≠ Marketing Environment Analysis

As part of this platform, we also explore the **macro** and **microenvironmental** forces that affect organizations operating in the network infrastructure and traffic analysis sector:

- **Macroenvironment**
  - Political and legal factors
  - Economic and technological trends
  - Sociocultural influences
  - Physical and natural conditions
  - Demographic shifts

- **Microenvironment**
  - Supplier and intermediary roles
  - Competitive landscape
  - Target audiences and customer behavior

These analyses support strategic thinking and help position services in the broader digital and academic ecosystem.
